A synthetic dataset rendered with Blender for hand washing gesture recognition. 
Dataset includes synthetic RGB, depth, depth isolated and hand mask images.
Source codes includes Inception-V3, YOLO-8 and PointNet networks for training.
Pre-trained models of these networks are provided. 
RGB and Point Cloud samples of real world test data is included.
